# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
  Using Excel to visualize Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on a number of criteria. Goal to become more familiar with both basic Excel techniques and more advanced   tools.

# Analysis and Challenges
* Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date
There are some clear patterns in the data, 

  I had no hiccups when completing the project, but some aspects took longer than others. For example, filling in outcomes based on goal data was a bit tedious as I couldn't copy the formula across cells without adjusting dollar amount parameters (i.e., ">1000", ">5000", etc.), or across columns without adjusting outcome. Otherwise, I thought it was relatively straightforward with clear instructions. I could see COUNTIFS() and the concept of a function with multiple groups of parameters posing difficulty, but having experience with Excel and the use of formulas made it a little easier for me to implement.
